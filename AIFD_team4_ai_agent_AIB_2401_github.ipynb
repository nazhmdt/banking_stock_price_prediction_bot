        "This project shifts focus from theoretical LLM exploration to **practical, production-oriented development**. We have built a fully functional **Stock Prediction System** accessible via a user-friendly Telegram Bot.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system integrates:\n",
        "1.  **Real-Time Data Pipeline**: Fetches live market data (OHLCV) via `yfinance`.\n",
        "2.  **Generative AI Core**: Utilizes **Google Gemini 2.5-Flash** as the reasoning engine to analyze volatility, macro-factors, and technical indicators.\n",
        "3.  **Visualization Engine**: Generates dynamic Chart PNGs with volatility thresholds (Green/Red/Orange segments).\n",
        "4.  **Asynchronous Architecture**: Built on `python-telegram-bot` to handle multiple user requests concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Key Capabilities\n",
        "*   **Target Price Prediction**: Algorithmically extracts specific price targets from AI reasoning.\n",
        "*   **Confidence Scoring**: Internal validation model estimates the confidence of prediction (e.g., 85%).\n",
        "*   **Analysis Reports**: Delivers structured \"Hedge Fund Style\" reports including Risk/Reward ratios and macro context.\n",
